# Lambda-Plugins
Repo for my plugins for [Lambda Client](https://github.com/Lambda-client/Lambda).

## ARCHIVED: Support will __not__ be provided.
Bottom line: my fork of kami blue with the rest of the modules to be ported vanished for some reason, so I can't really continue those. Also getting really burnt out of client dev stuff
